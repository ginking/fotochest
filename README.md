#FotoChest

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/fotochest/fotochest.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/fotochest/fotochest)


FotoChest is a open source photo sharing/gallery solution that you can host yourself.  One of the primary goals
in developing FotoChest is to always provide easy access to your photos and data through APIs.



## Developing

Development is done using Salt and Vagrant so you'll need vagrant, salty-vagrant, and virtualbox to get started.

To get the development environment up and running simply:

```
vagrant up
```

This will take a while so go grab some coffee.
