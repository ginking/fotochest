THIS IS THE DEV BRANCH PLEASE GRAB THE MASTER (STABLE) BRANCH TO USE IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.

There are a few minor issues in the master (stable) release.  Once dev becomes stable we will migrate over to master to fix those outstanding
issues.

##Platform

Written on the CodeIgniter framework.

##Installation

Follow the installation directions in the help guide that is included in the package.

Currently there is no installer however, installation is as simple as setting up a new CI install.  This release is done enough to be considered stable,
but as with all software there are still issues.  Paid hosting plans are available from FotoChest.com
